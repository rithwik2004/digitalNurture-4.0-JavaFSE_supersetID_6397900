Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller sub-problems of the original problem.
Two types of recursion used in the program. The time complexity of the techniques are as follows:
->Naive Recursion
  O(n) time  complexity
  O(n) space complexity
->Memoized Recursion
  O(n) time complexity
  O(n) space complexity
  It is faster compared to Naive Recursion as it avoids redundant recalculations.
